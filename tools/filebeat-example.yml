################### Filebeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Filebeat ######################################
filebeat:

  prospectors:
    # Each - is a prospector. Below are the prospector specific configurations
    -
      # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
      # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
      # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
      # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
      # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.

############################# Libbeat Config ##################################
# Base config file used by all other beats for using libbeat features

############################# Output ##########################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# Multiple outputs may be used.
output:

  ### Logstash as output
  logstash:
    # The Logstash hosts
    hosts: ["c002-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.in.laas.runabove.com:5044"]

    # Number of workers per Logstash host.
    worker: 1

    # Set gzip compression level.
    #compression_level: 3

    # Optional load balance the events between the Logstash hosts
    #loadbalance: true

    # Optional index name. The default index name depends on the each beat.
    # For Packetbeat, the default is set to packetbeat, for Topbeat
    # top topbeat and for Filebeat to filebeat.
    #index: filebeat

    # Optional TLS. By default is off.
    tls:
      # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
      certificate_authorities: ["c:/Projects/SEO-Dashboard/certificat/laas-ca.crt"]

      # Certificate for TLS client authentication
      #certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

      # Client Certificate Key
      #certificate_key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

      # Controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host name.
      # If insecure is set to true, all server host names and certificates will be
      # accepted. In this mode TLS based connections are susceptible to
      # man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing.
      #insecure: true

      # Configure cipher suites to be used for TLS connections
      #cipher_suites: []

      # Configure curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites
      #curve_types: []


  ### File as output
  #file:
    # Path to the directory where to save the generated files. The option is mandatory.
    #path: "/tmp/filebeat"

    # Name of the generated files. The default is `filebeat` and it generates files: `filebeat`, `filebeat.1`, `filebeat.2`, etc.
    #filename: filebeat

    # Maximum size in kilobytes of each file. When this size is reached, the files are
    # rotated. The default value is 10 MB.
    #rotate_every_kb: 10000

    # Maximum number of files under path. When this number of files is reached, the
    # oldest file is deleted and the rest are shifted from last to first. The default
    # is 7 files.
    #number_of_files: 7


  ### Console output
  # console:
    # Pretty print json event
    #pretty: false


############################# Shipper #########################################

shipper:
  # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
  # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
  # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
  #name:

  # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
  # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
  # logical properties.
  #tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

  # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
  # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
  # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
  #ignore_outgoing: true

  # How often (in seconds) shippers are publishing their IPs to the topology map.
  # The default is 10 seconds.
  #refresh_topology_freq: 10

  # Expiration time (in seconds) of the IPs published by a shipper to the topology map.
  # All the IPs will be deleted afterwards. Note, that the value must be higher than
  # refresh_topology_freq. The default is 15 seconds.
  #topology_expire: 15

  # Internal queue size for single events in processing pipeline
  #queue_size: 1000

  # Configure local GeoIP database support.
  # If no paths are not configured geoip is disabled.
  #geoip:
    #paths:
    #  - "/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat"
    #  - "/usr/local/var/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat"


############################# Logging #########################################

# There are three options for the log ouput: syslog, file, stderr.
# Under Windos systems, the log files are per default sent to the file output,
# under all other system per default to syslog.
logging:

  # Send all logging output to syslog. On Windows default is false, otherwise
  # default is true.
  to_syslog: false

  # Write all logging output to files. Beats automatically rotate files if rotateeverybytes
  # limit is reached.
  to_files: true

  # To enable logging to files, to_files option has to be set to true
  files:
    # The directory where the log files will written to.
    path: c:\Projects\SEO-Dashboard\debug\

    # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
    name: filebeat.log

    # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
    # automatically rotated
    rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

    # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
    keepfiles: 7

  # Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
  # Other available selectors are beat, publish, service
  # Multiple selectors can be chained.
  #selectors: [ ]

  # Sets log level. The default log level is error.
  # Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
  level: debug
